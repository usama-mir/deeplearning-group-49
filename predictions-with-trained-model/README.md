# Image segmentation of carparts

This is the repository for image segmentation of car parts in relation to the course DeepLearning at DTU. 
The repo consists of a DataLoader that takes .npy files and converts them to tensors to feed a CNN model.  The CNN model can be found in <Insert link>. 

## To get started

The code needs to be run on a HPC. The recommended setup is to use miniconda with the packages specified in the environemtn.yml file. This ensures compatibility in code runs.
